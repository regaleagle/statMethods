i am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging " palm kernel oil " as an ingredient do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil cocoa butter and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many " organic " things are added to it for many years now it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases

i have been a fan since valotte and i like the other reviewers here ca n't believe why this cd did n't receive the airplay it deserves ! there must have been some politics in there with sean 's cd coming out on the same day ( yoko ? ) it is one of those cds that you just leave on and you do n't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you do n't like ! i love every song ! ! especially " day after day " " i should have known " " i do n't want to know " and my fav right now " cold " i hope that what i have heard is true that he is working on his latest now ca n't wait ! buy this cd you wo n't regret it

i have had this camera since jan ' 05 and have so far taken approximately 10 000 shots while on trips and at weddings do n't expect much from it and you will be happy as an entry level dslr it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions i find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light provided that they are not moving cons : in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well battery dies fast the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting especially when shooting in raw mode i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode ( approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies surprisingly when shooting jpegs i get more shots per charge ( over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike so i always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) the viewfinder is very dim when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d 's viewfinder in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap especially when having to resort to manual focus autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible when shooting indoors the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus the 420ex flash is supposed to " talk " to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed however with the 300d this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over / under exposed after about five months the shutter button started sticking i would click it and then it would remain depressed the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button and since there is only one thumbwheel it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed for example if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera this is a real annoyance so would i recommend this camera : if you are a casual point and shoot person it 's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately look elsewhere

released by atlantic five years after it appeared in australia presumably to meet high demand for ac / dc 's music this international version of " dirty deeds done dirt cheap " is a farce once again somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence and replacing both " rip ( rock in peace ) " and " jailbreak " two of the strongest numbers in the album 's aussie version with tnt 's " rocker " and " love at first feel " an ok if not spectacular song ah and " problem child " already featured in atlantic 's version of " let there be rock " is also included in here the same song in two different " official albums " marvelous ! oh yeah and somebody hired hipgnosis in order to re-design the front and back covers that was a cute detail but the aussie version 's covers ( classic mid 70 's cartoonish artwork ) are far more appealing who 's to blame for this rip off ? somebody at atlantic records ? some members of ac / dc ? maybe both ? who cares anyway ? once again now that i 've got used to the aussie album listening back to this " product " feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated low quality spirits every enthusiastic record collector knows that both warner music and sony music are serious labels that took and still take risks by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will so it seems that with their approval of this re-issue the surviving members of ac / dc are the ones to blame for this farce to go on and on and on if this is so well guys we the fans made you filthy rich we deserve the " real deal " available worldwide at a " reasonable price " i only give this " product " a 2 star rating just because " love at first feel " remains unreleased in australia how unusual ! a final word about this re-issue : i do n't own it in the words of pete townshend i " wo n't get fooled again " in order to get bonus material you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome internet gimmick if bon scott ( undisputedly the band 's most uncompromising member ever ) was still alive i believe things would be different by the way if you are interested in the real stuff please be so kind as to read my review of " dirty deeds done dirt cheap " ( import ) other items to be avoided : the skimpy " retrospective " ep " ' 74 jaibreak " and " bonfire " a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice in different versions none of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of ac / dc 's first four aussie albums

i have found another product that i want to recommend it 's called alert and is sold by consultants like avon but you can also go the starlight website and order it it 's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters and as a bonus i do n't feel hungry when i 'm using it they also have a product specifically for weight loss i have tried that as well i did feel a bit jittery at first but it settled after a week or so of taking it i would recommend it also i used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs i did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss but i credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings i 'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need energy and hunger control and it 's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it i 've used this for years and have not had any problems

in theory this camera is perfect fits into your pocket video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of mpeg-4 pictures are good if you know how to finesse it perfect all around anytime camrea right ? here 's the thing i got the camera mainly for video i just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that i could always have on me also i did not want minidv because uploading to the computer is real time i wanted the sd card as film even if it would sacrfice some video quality but the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor / auotfocus nosie on the playback i cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses it sounds like someone smoking a hooka and get this it even says so in the instruction manual page 35 " caution during video clip playback the sound of a motor is audibleduring recording the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded this is not a malfunction " awful by the way the take a picture while recording video function is worthless it leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording and the still image captured is usually blury whats the point anyway i think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video or you can do it with whatever editing software you use oh and one last thing i have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic my hand shakes too much there is a digital stabalization for the video but no optical stabilization for the stills its a big shame too the camera is very cool if not for the audible motor noise i would have given this at least an 8 / 10 but the lens motor noise is unacceptable ! ps all cameras today should have a built in lens cover this is one has a cheap plastic one that you 'll probably lose

despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release i need to be honest and explain why i am giving just one poor star no i am not crazy let me explain my point-of-view and after that you can decide if this jh album really deserves more stars just to start this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band ( ? ) or the musicians thru a solid path there are tracks played by a duo trio 4tt and sometimes a very loose quintet and each of these tracks have a different mood without any presence of a jazz soul or even a real smell of jazz maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage / tribute to mr strayhorn or maybe a recognition for mr henderson value in the 20th century jazz history as one of the most important hard-boppers ever but the result was very poor if you really love joe henderson ( as i appreciate ) try any of his albums from the 60 's ( as a band-leader or as a sideman ) mainly those from the blue note era in time : i gave one star in memory of his brilliant carreer this particular album deserve zero-star

well at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit based on a book written on 1902 it 's nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era the plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward but also his future wife he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date to our more contemporary ( and one hopes more enlightened ) attitudes there 's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever in some ways this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material ; in another way it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie all of this would n't matter much if the movie was entertaining ; unfortunately it is only intermittently so

we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism naturally only time will tell if this is any different but in the meantime here 's what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i 've owned thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n't need me to tell you this right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying though sometimes it does not appear very clear especially if the subject is not static however it is bright and rich in color 3 ) infolithium - this is sony 's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately of course if use is consistent will provide you with a good idea if you use one function then another then another it tends to vary much more and is not as useful 4 ) integrated charger / usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger though the bright white color is far from a match the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it i am not speaking about macros but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small near objects such as coins stamps or text quick focus on objects farther away though 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice i do n't know if the battery is universal but even if it is it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony 's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard but this camera uses the memorystick duo which is about 1 / 4 or so smaller than the " regular " memorystick this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark within a few feet is okay but farther subjects are not touched 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate you can certainly take pictures in bursts but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick previewing the images is also slow this is also disappointing as it 's not faster than my older p52 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod you have to mount the camera on the plastic station then connect the tripod to the plastic dock this is far from ideal well there you have it the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you in which case this could be a great value for you i am certainly happy with it but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards compatibilities and dubious long-term quality

the decalogue is one of several excellent tv series by european directors that puts us tv to shame like bergman 's " scenes from a marriage " & " fanny & alexander " von trier 's " the kingdom " fassbinder 's " berlin alexanderplatz " kusturica 's " underground " and petersen 's " das boot " the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers ' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run unlike these other series kieslowski 's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block ( and characters from one episode may pop up in another ) the stories of the dekalog are morality plays but they are not re-enactments of the ten commandments but rather inspired by them and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two kieslowski & piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves ( instead of contracting 10 of poland 's best up & coming director 's to do each as was initially planned ) and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories i wo n't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them so i will comment on kieslowski 's style kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature his films often tackle issues of political import however he intentionally avoids making " issue films " but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before during & after the solidarity movement initially he started as a documentary film maker but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects he switched to his unique fictional style this facets 3-disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available in that the picture quality is a little better however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series first facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu to add to that you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode very annoying then the picture quality is n't as good as it could be not only is there evidence of flaws in the film ( scratches and blotches ) but the film is n't a true digital copy of the original series but rather a copy of someone 's pal tape of the broadcast so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape the picture is also cropped from the original especially on the bottom the picture at times jitters especially during the ending credits the english subtitles are minimal at times missing dialogue and can not be turned off there are some nice extra features particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub & use subtitles instead apparently all of the other ( imported ) editions of the dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition which is inexcusable given the price

im going to rate this product a 2 because i like it but i would change a few things if i could it does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff the couple of things i would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds then you have to stop and click play again i wish there was an option where you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again the other thing is something a little more important the product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play its called olga well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore so you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the beetles or metalica or the grateful dead or anyone else and thats what they advertise " play hit songs " so overall knowing all this i would have shopped around more especially for the price its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs

i disagree with several of the reviews here which cite several specific points of contention as making the book entirely worthless i think it easily earns 45 - 5 stars it is over a decade old now and i do n't think it is intended as a source for scholars of english but for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read i ca n't compete with some of the above reviewer 's scholarly points but i do n't think replacing some of bryson 's dogma with their own is worthwhile mother tongue is a great starting point and very educational " bryson 's dictionary of troublesome words " is also a great introduction and gets 5 stars from me

certainly this album offers very little to a fan of the ocean blue 's eariler work the vocals and guitars sound quite different ( gone is that beautiful dreamy sound ) and what about those awesome saxaphone and keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun ? just because steve lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether so anyway what does this album offer instead ? harder sounding guitar angrier sounding vocals and songs that are somewhat intersting but are lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after you 've had the cd for a couple weeks exceptions : & quot ; whenever you 're around&quot ; and & quot ; slide&quot ; are good enough songs to standout inspite of boring production

this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths and underlying the story are indeed echoes sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted of ancient myths god is allegorized as gabalawi the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel ; the second that of moses and pharaoh ; the third that of jesus ; the fourth that of muhammad then there is a fifth story in which the central figure a ` magician ' is presumably a scientist he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi ` who had been easier to kill than to see' it makes no difference : the scientist who has invented a weapon of great destructive power is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever though they remain hopeful that one day ` magic ' will put an end to their suffering subtle the book is not either in content or in style ; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent they mostly ` shout ' ` scream ' ` shriek ' ` yell ' ` cry ' or ` sneer ' which becomes rather tiresome the literary quality of this novel is i think greatly inferior to mahfouz 's rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written : it has been banned in egypt ; its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author 's life

i feel that it is just way too much money for what you get i own a lot of professional ( canon ) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there but it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price i have the s80 no complaint there the leather case was just way too tight which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera the flap issue is an issue the neck chain is a bit short and similar and better items can be had for a lower price if you shop around you can also find the li battery for less i 'm not upset but just disappointed with what i got for the price

i have now seen several gerry anderson projects many hits and some misses this one is close to dead last for me ( wait it is dead last ) a priest driving a model t is the hero in this one he also has a shrinking ray ( shrinks to like 1 / 3 normal ) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper / secret agent sound interesting ? well i got the set cheap so why not buy it ? if your an anderson fan as i am it was worth the price just do n't expect to show it to your friends as it 's really tame and slow plodding with model t car chases and not a whole lot of action here is my ranking of the shows i like from gerry anderson so take that into account of your own tastes #1 ufo ( a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development ) #2 joe 90 ( the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here ) #3 captain scarlet ( i love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me ) #4 thunderbirds ( had a corgi toy as a kid it was the best show for kids on tv at the time ) #5 stingray ( for the time it was a great action kids show ) #6 fireball xl5 ( like a stingray except in space and black and white ) #7 the protectors ( eh it 's ok ) #8 space 1999 ( this is where my recommended shows stop this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even i could n't stay with it in the 70 's ) #9 terrahawks ( just started watching it now it may move up above space 1999 and the protectors ) #10 secret service i have n't watched his other stuff and i know there is stuff out there like supercar but that would probably rank above secret service for me

while " scary movie 4 " does work in getting out a couple of laughs it certainly does not live up to the past three many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly are getting pretty old although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as the grudge saw and war of the worlds it misses the funny mark just by a bit personally i felt they could have done a lot more in terms of parodying these films particularily with the grudge the writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier and really was it necessary to spoof films such as brokeback mountain and millionaire dollar baby both of which are not horror films ? i believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience and is vastly different from what scary movies 1 & 2 offered ( which i found to be extremely hilarious ) if you 're looking for over the top funny look towards the other scary movies

i generally like elmore leonard this is the twelfth book of his i 've read ranging from his detroit crime capers to his la-set chili palmer stuff to some of his westerns other than the terrible " be cool " this is probably my least favorite of his books so far set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934 the story follows carlos " carl " webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot us marshall the story takes place in the dusty midwest mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city as carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves carl is a somewhat vain cocky lawman with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man a no account young man who has everything he needs but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl 's path mixed into this are kinds of period details from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to " true detective " writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers pretty boy floyd john dillinger and bonnie and clyde barrow despite all this background detail the story itself failed to engage me there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard 's best work there 's a good guy a bad guy and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic in fact about halfway through the book i realized that the " real story " was n't going to kick in - - i was in it ! and unlike many leonard books the supporting cast of characters is n't particularly memorable even leonard 's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech ultimately one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period and perhaps did n't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story that said the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story given the time and place all in all unless you 're really really into the whole ' 30s gangster thing not worth the time

read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child 's nusery i absolutely love it before this my son could not sleep well with our " family 's " humiifier because it was too noisy within an hour of bringing this home it was set up ( very easily ) and he took one of many 2 1 / 2 hour naps that week ! no filters no noise no problems thus far ! i did have it on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water underneath but the humidifier was near a window and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top ( the problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop ) filling it is a snap and the very fine mist ( looked like small stream of fog ) was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal ! the tank seems to last longer than the box states it is on it 's third day on a low / med setting and it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top i love the safety features and i do n't have to worry about the tank still on if it 's empty since it has an automatic shut off ! the light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room it is a design that will last thoughout his childhood ! thank you crane !

i am a br5-49 aficionado from the early days at robert 's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks admittedly i long for those days as much as i long for stirrups in major league baseball so i 'm nostalgic " it 's a free country " it is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels yet whenever i read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has " matured " i can do nothing but cringe here 's the flowchart : band starts out - band plays hard - band gets cult following - band gets reputation - band strikes out on road - band gets contract - band gets a little more pub - band gets contract with bigger label - band gets new management supplied by label - band gets " coached " in next recording - band changes faces along the way - band changes label again - band gets new direction from new label - band fights for identity - band produces new " mature " album - band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process gee i sure hope this is n't how the end of br5-49 comes about but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion this record is ok of course i realize that any band ca n't just re-hash the same ' ol stuff on every album but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl one part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals and a simple taste of this is what i sorely miss in the last few recordings this band live used to be a wild jittery moving organism on stage and although they are still a solid live show ( saw them on the last tour at poor david 's pub in dallas ) something has settled down chuck is a great talent but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of chuck and gary bennett ok i 'll go cry me a river but dammit just go listen to the big backyard beat show one more time mature ? i just do n't want to grow up that bad

there is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from how to cook without a book : recipes and techniques every cook should know by heart by pam anderson ( not the big-breasted one ) and that is the art of the highly marketable title for starters this artful moniker really plays on the single gal 's fears about never being able to put together nutritious attractive varied affordable and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week you want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world so the plus side of this book is the title that 's where it ends the big idea here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook by : a ) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation and b ) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques sounds interesting so far right ? well the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on " canned low-sodium chicken broth " which i think is a bit of a weird ingredient it 's even included in the salad dressings other big hitters include : heavy cream butter and sour cream do people really eat like this ? regularly ? why not make the easy fruit parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal ? just take a tall glass drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar and some berries repeat until the glass is filled crikey sour cream brown sugar and berries ? ! ? would n't it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of greek honey ? am i totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing ? or if calories are no object anyway why not pick up some baskin robbins ' rocky road on the way home from work ? that 's easy and it 's worth the internal havoc it will cause oh and here 's a sample mnemonic device that i ca n't not share it 's that good : " cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil then toss in some pasta that 's fresh from the boil " pure genius right ? right in a way the author was right - i can cook all these things without a book but why would i want to

it 's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer yeah maybe my fish can get a record deal : they " sing " in tone can breath but refue to lip-synch ( i know it sounds gay ) this is just sad because bands that play their own instruments write their own songs and perform their own songs can pretty much get almost no attention let 's take the band king 's x : doug pinnick ( vocals / bass ) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about god ( king 's x is a christian band ) ; ty tabor ( guitar / vocals ) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably do n't know ; and jerry gaskill ( drums / vocals ) has some pretty complicated rhythm patternsyet only like a few dozen people ( i know a lot more people than that like kx ; i 'm just exagerating ) seem to like this band it 's sad if you want good music listen to the band i just menioned ( king 's x if you were n't paying attention ) ( if amazon does n't post this i will seriously get poed !

dr hawkins first book power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology however he began to venture into misapplication of this method and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity concept or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement there are serious logical philosophical and practical flaws in his work and his attempt to quantify matters that are n't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques the actual technique is worthwhile but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate valid answers hawkins explores issues about media politics religion spirituality history philosophies healing arts entertainment and more and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters liars and two-faced sociopaths he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and do n't resort to hawkins ' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current effortsconsciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful responsible work in those areas for now i 'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world

having used the office programs for some time i was a bit put off by the new ribbons which replace the old menus i guess that office needed a new look but i am not sure if i buy the advertising that the ribbon will make my work more productive some things that you should know about office 2007 and ultimate in general the licensing agreement allows you to install office 2007 ultimate on two computers one of them being a laptop i found this clause in the legal agreement and even called microsoft legal to confirm if you make modifications to the quick access toolbar ( and who wo n't do that ? ) and you want to take these changes with you to another computer the files for the toolbars are located at : c: \documents and settings\username\local settings\application data\microsoft\office where username is your username something i have found handy when working with my two computers one thing that i do n't like is that the file name extensions have changed gone is the familiar doc for word documents now the file extension is docx if you want to create a document that can still be opened by prior versions of word you must purposefully choose to create a doc file but you lose some of the functionality of the new files the docx file this format is not the same as the opendocument standard microsoft promises that older versions of word can still open the docx files but i have not tried it and i do n't buy into everything that microsoft promises until i see it happen why could n't microsoft just leave the files the same as they have always been ? office 2007 does look slick and i anticipate that i will warm up to it in the future as i get used to the new command structure

i found the product to work very well for antivirus spyware and spam it is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance i had been using norton 2004 but it only did a good job on viruses although it would detect spyware after the fact it did a poor job of removing them i had also used the ms beta which although detected more spyware than norton would not block it i had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware since i installed pc-cillin i 've had no problems i 've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well catching about 80% of the spam i had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam so this is a big improvement my only complaint is the rebate - i sent in the required info and it was rejected due to " invalid / missing ups " i then sent a copy of the ups they indicated that was missing but never got anything back

i read the review centering on the box the dvd comes in and must admit that i was stumped as well it was " different " but i do n't foresee this as being a problem overall the new office ultimate 2007 loaded quickly how quickly ? well i had to check my new vista hp notebook because i could n't believe that it packed all of the programs onto the system in such a short amount of time it asked for the product key and one or two other bits of data but that was it out of all the office suites i have owned this one loaded so quickly i was sure there was a problem nope access outlook word powerpoint publisher onenote excel groove and a host of others were there ready to be activated ( do n't worry ; you only do it once not for each separate program naturally if you are like me and totally dependent upon email you 'll activate outlook first ) the new office " feels " different the ribbons are ok but i would suggest that they allow us the option to retain the classic ( xp ) view i rely quite a bit on the research task pane and i do n't mind telling you that it was difficult to find the menu bar is a bit on the thin side and having so many icons on the top added clutter and confusion at least for me of course finding the research task pane could have been quickly resolved if microsoft had put a product manual in the box ( yes the online help is nifty but sometimes a man just needs to read about it from a manual instead of printing it out ) all in all you will find all of your old favorites and true to the office legacy they really have not changed enough to warrant a major release but i 'm willing to bet that after all is said and done office ultimatae 2007 will become the industry standard

my arms used to get so sore because i 'd blow-dry my thick frizzy curly hair for about 1 1 / 2 hours and then have to go over it again with a cheapy flat iron from wal-mart after having a stylist at mastercuts use this on my hair and achieve even better results in under half an hour i knew i had to buy this product this is a great price considering at most places like trade secret the iron alone can cost about $129 plus tax plus the chi products are $15 and up it 's a great value and it benefits a great cause so why not ? so if you have unruly thick curly hair - this is the product for you ! just be careful because it does get really hot - i burned my ear a bit other than some common sense anyone can use it and achieve great results i tried messing with it to flip out my hair and curl it and i 've almost got it down

i was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review it 's lightweight but sturdy easy to assemble and disassemble and very adjustable i used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted like a short tripod and it was wonderful it 's also nicely finished and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs it stays together and does n't flop around while you 're toting it unfortunately that evening i had trouble docking our new sony camcorder and when i looked at the bottom of the camcorder i saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera ! to my great relief i was able to pull out the pin with no trouble but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes i was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod so this is not " consumer error " ( i ca n't keep the quick-release plate permanently attached because then i ca n't dock the camcorder bad on sony therebut still ) your mileage may vary but this tripod is going back to amazon and i 'll be shopping for another brand

following 2002 's self-produced and underrated under rug swept morissette returns in 2004 with so-called chaos with this release morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she 's aspiring to take hollywood by strom but is n't 100% sure maybe the new look and image might have worked if morissette 's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it 's not this cd starts out good with the opening cut " eight easy steps " a fast-paced rockin ' tune with alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment " out is through " follows and also stands out but then so-called chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge and morissette should never have brought john shanks or tim thorney ( or both ) on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks " doth i protest too much " is without a doubt the worst song alanis has ever recorded the title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by morissette 's lyrics ( yes not her best work ) when she refers to heartburn headaches and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle the tracks continue with " all of me " and " this grudge " both rather dull while the closing track " everything " was a weak choice for the first single morissette has always been a progressive artist but so-called chaos does n't measure up to any of its predecessors and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place

i use three razors last year 's model of this braun a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors ok now let 's do some math i get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor i pay on average 40c or so for a disposable razor that is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream at a nickel a shave it would take 3000 shaves before i would spend $150 would take me over 8 years now anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor ( not even the expensive triple edged ones just cheap disposables ) is dreaming the blace does a much better job and much faster but sometimes they can irritate the skin but electrics can too i can get irritated by both sooooo i rotate between them and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well i bought this braun ( last year 's model ) after reading the positive reviews here and later bought a rotary razor the basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter shaves just as well and cost me about 1 / 3 the price the only thing that is better in the braun is the battery lasts longer it is possible also that in some cases it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times i go over them the braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer like when i have two to three days growth the rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush the cleaning machine / charger that comes with the braun is a joke yes it cleans the razor great but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom even then say you have that larger space you can pay between $500 and $800 each for the cleaning cartridges i have found they last about a month before drying out add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor the rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water finally the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade so i am constantly locking the blade position by accident inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price do n't get me wrong this razor shaves fine it works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors but for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade does the price difference sound rational to you ? if it does click " proceed to order "

presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a prince album or two but do n't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection the way this is laid out though is confusing at best : disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable ( " my name is prince " ? his take on " nothing compares 2 u " when sinead o'connor 's is definitive ? ) disc 2 compiles 12 " mixes and remixes and similar raritiesie for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat his purpleness every records bottom line : this is haphazardly thrown together middle range fans are better off with the hits / the b-sides which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material ( some of which equals his singles )

this is the first movie i remember seeing as a kid i loved it it was my favorite then i did n't get to see it again for several years ( stupid blockbuster ! ) when i finally saw it again i still liked it i like it as i write this very day the music is good ( the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to but helps the mood anyway ) the animation 's good too and i actually know what i 'm talking about ! ( how often does that happen ? ) see what happens a lot of the time is that people blame colors they do n't like or designs that are annoying or whatever on the animation but it is n't the animation 's fault ! the way the thing on-screen moves is the only thing the animators do mostly so if you really want to criticize the animation look at how they move not what they look like do you see ? i think that really most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about books when i was little my dad read me " the lion the witch and the wardrobe " and " the hobbit " ; things like that so naturally i loved books and stories this is practically the only movie i 've seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere it 's obvious that the filmmakers themselves ( or at least a lot of the people working on it ) actually like to read that 's really why i like the pagemaster so if you like to read watch this movie if you do n't ( you utter nincompoop ) stay away and do n't criticize what you have no comprehension of

looking at the liner photos makes clear that falkner is the prettiest thing this side of n sync ( and does n't he know it especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of johnnie walker black by a leggy bunny flight attendant ) which raises the question : is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an artist ? not to put too fine an edge on it let 's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent falkner does everything on the cd and my reaction is so what ? his voice is mediocre ; his lyrics are banal ( & quot ; life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot ; ) or precious ( & quot ; suspended on this stage of grace i have to remember this sound&quot ; ) ; the layers of sound he tracks down are just that - - layers of sound with a disspiriting sameness song after song give him two stars simply because he can do all the stuff on the record but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to say chrissie hynde and john hiatt cds we 'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs

the lawsuit mentioned in mr john matlock " gunny " review has nothing to do with the quality or legality of documents created using quicken willmaker plus software instead it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license he used will-making software ( not quicken willmaker plus ) to write a will for an elderly client the trouble arose because he created the will outside of her presence and arranged for her to sign it while she was hospitalized apparently she never reviewed the will in other words he acted too much like a lawyer while the " unauthorized practice of law " is a vague concept had the insurance agent merely recorded the woman 's wishes and entered them verbatim into the software there would almost certainly have been no problem there is no problem with using software to prepare a will for your self nor is there a problem with using it to create a will for someone else if you merely type in that person 's answers at their direction the main way to run afoul of unauthorized-practice-of-law rules is to give legal advice to or prepare documents for others without their express detailed instructions

i think india is one of the most talented artists today her voice is sensational sadly as with many great artists today this album feels more producer / market-driven rather than artist-driven i understand that regaetton is popular right now i would even understand including a few reggaeton-flavored songs to " keep up with the times " ( shakira 's " la tortura " comes to mind ) but who mixes two genres within a single song ? ! ? " soy differente " flows perfectly as a salsa until regaetton beats come in the style feels very out-of-place in this song as in most other songs in this album maybe this kind of thing will work at a club but not for extended listening in my opinion the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling india 's own style i hope she will regain contol by the next album

first of all let me say this product is great in almost every way so if you need to feel better about your nose and / or throat go for it my main complain about the grossan hydro pulse is that it is noticeably expensive some time ago grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the hydro pulse but then grossan decided to produce his own machine and if i 'm right viajet is making it for him viajet sells the same machine except for the grossan tip at about -again - a half the price of the hydro pulse the breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive ( i have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country ) so what makes the hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health is a business after all other than that like i have said this product is great for almost any respiratory problem i used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle and is intended to use it over 50 times the hydro pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime so you get the idea also if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment look for the buteyko method

why not the plot and motivations are paper thin as is typical of porn milano wanders around campus wondering why she 's having so many sexual dreams even daydreams her boyfriend wanders about wondering if she 's so pure kemp wanders about seen by milano but often not by others lewis wanders about for some bisexual action other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action amid all this wandering there 's much carnal action and more carnal dreaming occasionally kemp kills someone for dissing milano john stanley ( in his creature features movie guide ) correctly refers to it as a " meandering almost formless script " kemp has the best lines like many vampires he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love his appearance is a touch effeminate ( too much eyeliner ) but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character he is part romantic vampire part bloodthirsty beast lewis 's small part is pointless to the " story " all that 's required is that she undress and when she does it was worth the wait rachel true ( the craft ) has an even smaller role the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on all of the above three are more interesting more charismatic than milano or her boyfriend at film 's end kemp 's tearful bloodthirsty angst and milano 's tearful rediscovery of her love the " tragic " star-crossed ending and the christian iconography all mirror coppola 's bram stoker 's dracula ( 1992 ) one senses that director goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material however this is no poor woman 's bram stoker 's dracula milano is no winona ryder and kemp is no gary oldman for that matter none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts and the budget just is n't there the strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity which this film tries to hide rather than utilize how low was the budget ? listen i was an extra on both bram stoker 's dracula and embrace of the vampire ( in both instances i kept my clothes on ) i worked one day on embrace of the vampire do n't look for me i ended up on the cutting room floor and extras are rarely mentioned in credits but let me tell you an " inside story " on the making of this film : we were shooting in a nightclub on the sunset strip the extras were divided into three camps : union nonunion and modesto extras union extras earn the most especially once overtime kicks in so they were wrapped after eight hours ( they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota ) this was during my nonunion days ( i 'm in sag now ) so i put in a full 14 hours after which we were paid in cash and wrapped the modesto extras were still working when we left now what you may ask is a modesto extra ? i also wondered and so i asked one i was told they were from an acting class in modesto california they had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a " class assignment " in other words they were paying to come to work there 's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra it 's neither glamourous nor difficult and nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are very easy to come by the lampposts in los angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle ehr extras i did it for the cash and because if you do it often enough you increase your chances of getting into the union ( which i did after some 13 grueling months ) never pay for the " chance " to be an extra not in los angeles i made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times but wised up after a few months my guess is the producers of embrace of the vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle and far less than even nonunion extras cost i know this teacher was getting paid by the students and that they were not getting paid to be on the film another inside story : someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member she was near tears because it had sentimental value never leave anything of value lying around on a set and some trivia : john stanley says this film was " originally conceived as the nosferatu diaries " but on the set we were told the working title was the collector embrace of the vampire is a decent time-killer barely if you 're looking for horror there are hundreds of better films dozens of better vampire films even many superior erotic vampire films - - vampyres ( british 1975 ) comes to mind but if you 're looking for milano nudies this is the film to see

i 'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about ( sounds like someone with an axe to grind ) but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship the music is inspired the melodies transcending and the emotion - deep and meaningful as far as " copying yanni " goes well - i do n't agree in fact yanni is far more generic and less inspired the sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact not the same nor are they yanni 's creation i write this review to commend mr farish on his work and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and could n't resist his own urge to see his " critique " in print ryans music is distinctly his own no question - and any similarities are tonal and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of as far as i 'm concerned you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve 's and websites for music to criticize - and well make themselves feel a little better personally i would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy all the other stuff is for hacks ! enjoy this music ! i do

first of all i am a fan of madonna 's music ( not all of it but a lot of it ) as well as a huge abba fan now i realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists and apparently it is here as well but why ca n't these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic ? gimme gimme gimme ( the abba song that is sampled here ) is a fairly simple song to begin with ( as many abba songs are ) but the complicated arrangements ( both vocally and instrumentally ) are what made abba 's songs interesting and fun to listen to but taking a few bars of the original song repeating it over and over and over adding a dance beat various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece i think she would 've been better off either following a similar chord progression to gimme gimme gimme or just doing a cover perhaps benny and bjrn should 've stuck to their strict " no sampling " rule here ! for some reason many of today 's dance / pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance a good example of a radio-friendly dance / pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is acoustic alchemy 's " so kylie " on their american / english album ( the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what 's going on you 'll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression ) now i 'm not going to say " hung up " is a terrible song because everyone has their own taste but i 'm sorry to say it just does n't do anything for me

have n't we all been there ? wishing we could be better than someone else ? wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight ? this is exactly how the movie " cheaters " affected me i found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this the plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question " what would i do in this situation ? " jeff daniels and jena malone give such incredible performances in this movie i believe that they are very convincing if you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie " cheaters " is the true direction for you to head in

by chance before picking this up i had just finished the heart is a lonely hunter by carson mccullers and was struck by the similarities and differences it 's a great " compare and contrast " pair as an exercise for high-schoolers both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary heart published in 1940 and castle in 1948 both about life in the 30s both families are poor in castle though there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs this is supposedly because they " do n't know how to do anything " so instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter how charming ! they are " eccentric " which seems enough in the author 's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves only stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper enamored of cassandra does work and gives the family his entire salary but he is of the class that is expected to toil after all even he is rewarded in the end- -able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum topaz- -striking poses unlike the looming and grinding poverty of heart then the poverty in the castle never amounts to more than a lark- -educated folks playing at being poor until they 're rescued by romantic circumstance not so in america where mick kelly who did n't know how to do anything either went off to work at woolworth 's and to a life of little hope in castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina the inheritance two dashing young wealthy americans one of whom has inherited the castle show up just in time with their chatty modern mum they throw money around and talk too much in the cliched extravagant american style most of the remainder of the novel consists of cassandra and her sister rose swooning over one brother or the other with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being it 's all so very charming bourgeois and harmless if your life is hard do n't worry- -a man will show up to rescue you ! the reviews for this novel in amazon are overwhelmingly positive smith was obviously talented her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read i wish she had given cassandra a little more ambition

works as advertised and i am happy with it 's function much nicer than other battery powered toothbrushes one issue is that supposed " quick change " tool to remove the brush head either i ca n't figure out or it is defective but once you put it on the brush head a pin is supposed to press into a slot to release the brush head it never releases is there a trick to do this ? also the instructions say put on the tool press in and then pull off the brush head the problem with this is once the tool is on and you press in there is no way to pull off the brush head as the tool is still attached once you take the tool off the brush head will not slide out anyone figured this out yet

saw " hart 's war " the other night and could n't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one this film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days here are ten reasons why : 1 this film is n't " the great escape " and even though he would probably like to think otherwise bruce willis is n't steve mcqueen even though willis received top billing this is a colin farrell vehicle 2 the vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the reagan administration much less world war ii " hart 's war " may just as well be a film about a pow camp during the war of 1812 anything with vin diesel or the rock would be bound to sell more tickets 3 as far as depicting life in a pow camp " hart 's war " is pretty much on par with " hogan 's heroes " the germans are nice guys with guns who do n't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything where did the gi 's get all those cigarettes anyway ? 4 any stalag luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the bruce willis character as look at him as depicted in " hart 's war " the camp commandant ( as portrayed by marcel lures ) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the german army his collection of american jazz / blues records is a cute writer 's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation or of the type of men who were in charge of german pow camps in reality the marcel lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic 5 the storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in pow camps one good example being the pow 's who were tried and hung in andersonville ; however the whole idea that the camp 's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a jerry springer type advocate is ludicrous 6 the idea that during the trial a group of pow 's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting not only did nothing like this ever happen during world war ii it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions the german army simply was n't that stupid 7 i saw this film once and did n't like it i thought that maybe the second time would be better it wasn't 8 beyond being sheer hollywood political correctness " hart 's war " seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment it ignores the real focus of life in such a stalag which for most pow 's was just day to day survival also the soldiers who served in our armed forces during world war ii and also happened to be african americans were n't spineless hapless dopes 9 bruce willis playing the same role in variations of " die hard " over and over and over again is tiring 10 better films about the same sort of subject matter are " the tuskeegee airmen " and " stalag 17 " hopefully in a few years " hart 's war " will be completely forgotten and these dvd 's will be rotting in some landfill

i grew up reading harold evan 's sunday times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem ; ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome ( i 'm irish ) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland however from today 's perspective the paper 's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as ` what would the world do without henry kissinger ? ' [indeed this has always seemed to be mr kissinger 's view also] ; and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles ( ss-20s ? ) being deployed in russian forests i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002 / 3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of saddam 's mobile chemical / biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist in saying all the above i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch the book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made evan 's sunday times great - the investigative reports from the insight team and others of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry ( thalidomide ) and the aircraft industry ( mcdonnell douglas ) ; the publication of the crossman diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet having established his credentials as a ` vertical ' journalist - evan 's term which he describes as ` seeking to get to the bottom of things ' - and lauding his proprietors the thomson 's for allowing him to do so the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr murdoch as owner the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating the thomson 's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of ` national directors ' guarantees which if breached were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times - one of the free worlds most revered titles in his description of the paper evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment - he sees it as the paper of record upholding fair non-partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people 's educational background almost every colleague is named and then his / her school and university are listed - for example joe smith winchester oxford to establish both social class and academic ( perhaps intellectual ) credentials he documents the ` four pillars ' of the times as its reporting of parliament its legal coverage its obituaries and its leader columns oh dear ! stolid stuff from the fearless vertical investigative editor nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan 's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which by implication criticise his predecessor as editor ( william rees mogg ) ; and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution looming behind this story is murdoch 's general management style - haphazard interventions secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth - murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors the text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone save perhaps murdoch evan 's second-in-command betrays him various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys the ` national directors ' turn out to be paper tigers ( this is too good a pun to delete ) the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken piecemeal the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious double-dealing murdoch whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval however by the time i got to this section i had sadly lost a lot of respect for evan 's impartiality his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities this was reaffirmed in my mind when on the day that evan 's agreed to reign who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger ! in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor initially at least popular evans though personally engaging - and i 'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates ; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union the fading indeed failing social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change the rest of the story - evans attractive forthrightness murdoch 's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story are ultimately a side show this book is well told highly dramatic and engaging however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done

old spice is a great-smelling cologne and i 've worn it for years my dad wore it when i was growing up and i remember he almost always smelled of it it 's a great cologne for lean athletic guys who love retro ; it 's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men it takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff the smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention otherwise he 'll just be annoying old spice cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time ; exposing it to heat helps to age it ( leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building ) trust me it smells awesome if you let it age i meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle i 'm proud to say i 'm carrying on the tradition of wearing old spice cologne it 's not nerdy and it 's not just for older men it 's a cologne for any masculine guy it smells great

i ca n't believe none of the other reviews of the ultra lounge series state that these cd 's contain almost all instrumental music with very few songs that feature vocals i expect a lounge music cd to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks and of the four ultra lounge cd 's i purchased i count only three songs with vocals on all four of them while the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them the titles of the ultra lounge cd 's ( such as bachelor pad or bossanova ) mean very little as each cd fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks the best lounge cd i have heard so far is from an unlikely source i purchased it at pottery barn and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs keep this in mind when buying lounge music cd 's so that you wo n't be disappointed the way i was with the ultra lounge series

i give this book a 4 star rating not because i believe in " the necronomicon " but because this particular book has given some very interesting background and historical information on the occult scene in the 1970s the simon necronomicon itself is an interesting tome ( though i doubt it 's " authenticity " per se ) it is at least as valid a grimoire as any other and more valid than some " dead names " has provided a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds are generally not known as well as the unique " wandering bishop " phenomena and the so-called slavonic orthodox church overall both an informative and entertaining volume whether you " believe " or not

those who condemn this book for not being a long boring list of name origins and meanings or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today 's children are missing the point " baby names now " is a fun readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s including famous namesakes ( saints popes presidents royalty music and movie stars ) and what some celebrities have named their children it 's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style : for example " lisa " " amy " " susan " and " dawn " were very popular for babies born in the 60s ( and thus my classmates ) but are rarely used today the book 's major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire not just the first names at one point it reads " harrison fordis almost certainly the reason for the name harrison 's popularity " - excuse me ever hear of the beatles ? the entries for the name " jordan " do n't mention michael jordan certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area the entry for " jackson " does n't mention michael janet or samuel l the entry for " landon " does n't mention michael the entries for " cassidy " do n't mention david and shaun so popular in the 70s when many of today 's moms were growing up the entry for " lucas " - do i have to say it fellow star wars kids grown up and naming their children ? and come on how can you mention the name " wayne " without acknowledging the popularity of john wayne ? still this is a lot of fun and i give the authors credit for recognizing that " althea " is from a grateful dead song i look forward to the next edition

the first epilator that i used was the epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80's i did not use this for long a tool of complete torture ! i finally got brave enough to give epilators a try again and got one from " veet " which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job that i was completely hooked on using an epilator good-bye razors and wax ! i figured that if a single roller did a good job that the conair which had two rollers would do even better the conair does a good job and i 'm keeping it as my spare but the epilator from veet actually does a better job i no longer have any discomfort from the epilators and i even do my bikini area and underarms i love the results on my underarms and the money saved on waxing once you see and feel the results you will be completely won over update : i 've had more time to use the conair epilator and now i 've actually been using it more than my " veet " just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will be very happy with it as a matter of fact i am ordering one as a gift for one of my friends

i was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as rhapsody ( name changed due to copyright issues ) on their 2006 live album live in canada i have to say that i am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort the group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music the vocals tend to be oversung or drowned out by the chaos in the background rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements rhapsody of fire puts you to sleep with them the group does stay true to their fantasy themes however

i bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the pre-five in a row w / our preschooler and i do n't much like it i 've got a mother w / borderline personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's what-so-ever ( if i need a break away she hunts down my poor husband all my relatives and friends - ugh ) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her ' stalker mom ' mentality in the end i think if a person is from a semi-normal household w / proper respect for a child 's boundaries and need for space away from their parents then this book is okay i just find some moms are too smoothering - even ones w / o personality disorders - and this book does n't send a message about love as much as ' i own you' i like ' mama do you love me ? ' better for explaining to a child a parent 's unconditional love ' good-night moon ' by margaret wise brown however is by far my children 's all time favorite book i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed they love it and so do we as parents but this one even creeped my hubby out and he 's from a fairly ' normal ' family take it w / a grain of salt

darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games to make a commercial-quality game in this language would be lunacy basic just is n't quite flexible enough to do that with ease and the darkbasic renderer looks very very ugly however basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with if you 're trying to get into serious game development learn c++ and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source and make sure you 've learned a good deal of physics and math

if you 're reading this you want to upgrade your old computer to windows xp professional edition here are a few things to keep in mind first thing is you can download service pack two from windows update so no need to buy it integrated with xp these are what i consider the minimum system requirements : 256 mb of ram i have found is adequate more equals better 500 mhz or higher will do 7200 rpm hard drive will help a lot if you 're running windows millennium edition or 98 upgrade now the stability is vastly improved gone are the blue screens of death frequently asked question : is windows xp pro better than home edition ? windows xp pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing so for most users windows home edition is fine they both are based on the same code and are almost identical if you 're thinking of upgrading from windows 2000 i did because i like the gui interface better but windows xp is as stable as windows 2000 so it 's your call the plug-and-play ability of windows xp is totally great ! windows xp will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards network cards etc that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for cds with drivers i recommend upgrading to windows xp be a professional or home edition it is a great operating system have some fun and get it done

i was intrigued by his & quot ; the end of history &quot ; i thought his & quot ; trust&quot ; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation i only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of good books in the end & quot ; the great disruption&quot ; is a down right silly book it has a lot of usefull data but fukuyama 's humanistic ideology clouds it all all his empirical data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion : that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good fukuyama proves that the moral consensus - - the social capital - - of the earlier era has been wiped away that crime has sky-rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital he does n't bother to deal with societies - - like ethiopia - - that have never been able to build up enough social capital he does n't really look any further back in history past about 1950 his generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history he thinks ( based on his ideology of human goodness ) that things just have to get better if he had studied pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history he would know better people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long-term historical cycles for that i would recommend robert w fogel 's & quot ; the fourth great awakening and the future of egalitarianism &quot ; fogel a nobel prize winner has all the optimism of fukuyama but with the history to back it up

this out of all the many versions of jane eyre has to be my least favorite granted samantha morton has a very adorable fairy / elfin like face like mr rochesters description of her but her acting has no highs and lows she stands up to mr edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers seemingly no respect to her employer which is not fault of hers the writing of the script is bad and so the direction ciaran hinds is totally over the top he is so angry with no understanding his eyes are very lustful and at times crazed he is not at all like the character described in brontes epic book of a very sad and tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the innocence and singular personality of earnest honest and yet strong sweet jane eyre that charlotte bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words the over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comicalto me there is no love feeling or chemistry here between the two actors just lust he seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl and she though supposedy a virgin she dos n't act like one plus this movie seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story especially during janes childhood i do also miss the gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the dalton / clarke mini series which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story if you want to see great versions i highly rate the 1944 movie with orson wells though it is another abreviatd version that movie truly captured the spirit and feel it is moody dark and mysterious another is the fantastic timothy dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the brontes story dalton 's and clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime ! however if you are like me see them all and make your own decision they all have something to offer and most are entertaining

first the story takes place in the 1940s ( harold 's brother is mia in wwii not in vietnam as the amazoncom review erroneously states ) second the writing is superb mr lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel his characters are very real his setting ( a small struggling circus traveling the western us ) is historically believable peopled with ' freaks ' who suffer as sideshows unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with but peopled also with ' normals ' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks harold the 14-year-old albino central character tries to straddle both groups of people he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer i am admittedly ignorant about such things but mr lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants- -crucial to the plot of the novel- -seem believable my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end i do want you to read this book so i will try not to give anything away here but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character 's last words and even gomer pyle-like ( people actuallly say " gosh ! " ) this did detract from the impact of the death unfortunately but i still very strongly recommend this book five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot !

i bought this lens for my canon powershot g5 and because it requires the use of a long adapter not only does it cause terrible vignetting ( that circle the other poster thought was cool but which is actually a design flaw ) unless you zoom most of the way it blocks the built-in flash i have owned four canon cameras over the past 15 years and the g5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment ( i would have bought the digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses but it did n't allow flash exposure compensation ( insane for a $1000 camera body ) ) i do not recommend this lens or any of the g-series digital cameras from canon when i 've got the money i 'll be buying the latest digital rebel and upgrading some of my old eos lenses and selling my entire powershot kit if you are an experienced photographer you will not like this system at all

great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity though edited by bob blaisdell who presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day their messages speak for themselves a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections one is their brevity the speakers get to the point and make it clearly few inclusions run longer than five pages there is also a level of genuine ( and often sad ) honesty many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians ' efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation if such a thing was possible at the time the tone is often one of resignation but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed rightly or wrongly the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts the style could almost be considered anti-oratorical though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english nonetheless the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people separated by years language and geography who retain a clear-headed means of addressing their listeners

this film like most of his early work is for hitchcock aficionados only i am an admirer of hitchcock and also enjoy old british films but i still found this movie tough going not least because of the 110 mins running time the picture quality of this laserlight dvd is not perfect but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you 'd expect for the price the musical score is also okay but nothing to write home about laserlight do however pose a mystery that hitch himself would have been proud of this dvd has no commentary no documentary and no trailer not even one of those awful tony curtis intros so why do laserlight describe this dvd as a ' special edition '

i saw the movie in a theater when it first came out i was a teenager and although i believed it to be primarily a girl 's movie i did enjoy it i 've seen it several times since then and it still has not lost its charm when i finally did read the book i was disappointed that the movie did n't follow it more closely to me these are two different stories the holly in the movie is likeable ; the novella 's holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else ( when my wife saw the movie she remarked that holly was " an idiot " ) however the book 's storyline is more interestingmore haunting and the book 's ending is more intriguing the movie ends as a love story the book is much more and oh yes whatever you may think of capote as an individual the guy was a damn good writer

i am a huge fan of elvis costello and ran to the shop as soon as i read the great reviews of this album what a mistake ! ! ! very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version the cardboard cut salsa montuno of ' clubland ' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful ska sound of ' watching the detectives ' is lost in a jazz arrangement that does n't offer much to the melody elvis ' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of ' almost blue ' and most of the songs it worked well on his ' juliet letters ' album because the brodsky quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the metropole orkest it is just painful for me ' hora decubitus ' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble

the population of hong kong is approximately 7 million people i 'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie usually when a movie runs over 2 hours it 's because there 's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in in the case of hard boiled the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo 's desire to get into the guinness book of records for " most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture " chow yun-fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff he shoots ( usually with a pistol in each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture while swinging from a rope while sliding down a banister ( ! ) while being hurled through the air by explosions sometimes he even shoots while standing still and he shoots and shoots and shoots and the bad guys shoot and shoot and shoot and yun-fat 's fellow cops shoot and shoot and - - you get the idea there are some fine action scenes in this film but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended there was n't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next and it became painfully repetitious personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled there 's plenty of yun-fat 's balletic shoot-em-up action but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire

with the phenomenal success of " the poseidon adventure " the first disaster movie of its kind the sequel was sure to be a hit not so a plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great having a leading lady ( sally fields ) fresh from an oscar win and a few veteran actors ( michael caine karl malden ) might also sound promising unfortunately the magic of the set production of the original is not even close instead of upside ballrooms barber shops kitchens and bathrooms the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes the rest of the cast is comprised of television actors who are as wooden as the script there 's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous you wo n't even laugh in disbelief irwin allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel considering the original that 's a terrible shame

the dictators are incredible few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock ' n ' roll ideals as these guys have and their spinal-tap-meets-ramones-mees-beach-boys style almost always works - almost " manifest destiny " is a dissapointing release from the ' tators i mean its not a bad album but the guys can do much better than this there are a few good songs " disease " is hilarious particulary the spoken word act from handsome dick at the begining " science gone too far " is one of the band 's catchiest tunes proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s their closing cover of the stooges ' " search & destroy " is an okay interperatation of the classic however that 's about it the rest are mostly humorless fm-style rockers and while the dictators were n't selling out they were certainly trying to become more accesible download those three tunes and pick up every other album by the band

i installed norton antivirus 2007 immediately after installing windows vista office 2007 and other software on a new computer installation ran smoothly liveupdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch norton antivirus 2007 not only detects viruses it detects spyware and rootkits as well it has an inbound firewall and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities it does not protect against phishing identity theft or spam nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection when installed on windows vista norton antivirus takes over for windows defender and the windows firewall i did not expect the latter ; symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall norton antivirus integrates well with windows security center norton antivirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions norton antivirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products the only other product that i would use myself is mcafee virusscan but i have always felt that norton antivirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system for those of you installing norton antivirus 2007 as an upgrade i would highly recommend that you first remove any existing norton security products using add / remove programs in the control panel then download and run the norton removal tool from the symantec site to make sure that it 's all gone to see a comparison chart of the norton 2007 windows protection products as of this posting date browse to symantec 's site click on " norton 2007 products " under home products click on related link " view all products " and then click " compare " next to pc security

i was disappointed in this video i came to it not as a devout catholic but as a fan of travel videos in other words i watched this video with the same motivation i would have to watch shackleton 's antarctic exploration or something from the globe trekker series with that in mind the target audience for this video is not me it is the religious catholic therefore from my perspective i ca n't recommend it i 'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion i do n't enjoy worshipping the " holy father " or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the swiss guard if you are a devout catholic you will probably enjoy this video if you are not and just came to the video because you wanted a globe trekker style tour of the vatican you are likely to be disappointed and that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not

i 've been using norton antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with norton internet security 2003 now that it 's time to renewal norton antivirus i thought i switch to trend micro internet secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines i like norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the taskmanager considering i was running a p3 500 laptop with 196mb on winxp pro resources are valuable also newer norton antivirus version were a hit and miss after also reading reviews at amazon i took the plunge with trend micro my review of this product can be best summarize along with it 's relations to norton antivirus 2002 ( updated ) pros of trend micro 2005 : 1 fastest virus scan i 've seen i have not find any virus in my system yet whereas norton would fail in about 01% of the time ( ie one stalling virus every year ) 2 check incoming and outgoing mail like norton 3 scan selected files as i chose just like norton 4 alert and block virus threats 5 monitor nearby wifi connection 6 $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15 ( it 's been 2 months since i 've mailed it and not received it yet ) 7 uses about 10mb of system background resources versus norton 's 30mb cons against trend micro 2005 : 1 very annoying auto-virus update every day that i log on the internet i only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes i 'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so i would prefer to have a preference setting that i can choose myself norton is not as annoying 2 on a wifi network trend micro firewall failed 5 of the gibson research shields up test ports were open norton internet firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which was n't a big worry i ended up disabling trend micro firewall and using the norton firewall instead as it 's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection 3 anti-spam and data protection were subpar as i got advertisements and pop-up from certain websites like west cost major newspaper using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again 4 still waiting for rebate overall i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 for it 's fast virus check and a separate norton internet firewall is the ideal combo for me on it 's own merit trend micro would be perfect only if ram and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but i would n't mind using norton if i had plentiful more ram

i really wanted to give superman volume 3 a full 5 stars but unfortunately the quality control of the dvd release is poor hence the 1 star rating the dvd set i purchased skipped at the green lantern episode the replacement i got also skipped at the same place in addition the two-sided disc format with which all three dvd volumes have been released is a damage prone format luckily i was able to get a full refund but at this point i 'm not sure if or when i 'll try my chance at buying this set again the lack of quality control is too bad because volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series if you are fortunate enough to get a dvd set free of defects then you are really in for a treat bruce timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to superman as they did on batman : the animated series of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain darkseid throughout the series it finally gets put front and center in several episodes of volume 3 and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale i felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series

it 's amazing how a little common sense can turn into a million you know what's as soon as i tried these i realized how much better they are than the usual throat lozenges why ? because others cause you to suck on them and this strains your throat muscles which is bad gummi lozenges it 's genius why did n't i think of it then again i did but i did n't create airborne which is wonderful in itself really these lozengers are great at night if you use one they just stay pretty much stuck to the side of your throat and you can fall asleep without even the thought that you could shallow it and choke just remember how long it takes for a normal lozenge to disolve without bitting it ( even then ) these go pretty quick and without crewing ( which is the best way to use them ) i myself try to always have them in the house you should and will do the same after you try them also the price on amazon is the best i 'm about to order 10 boxes ( would order more but for the shipping charge which even with is still cheaper then target ) maybe the owner should put me on the payroll

eugene o'neill 's play " long day 's journey into night " is a pulitzer award winning autobiographical play about his family i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater i did not enjoy reading this play the tyrone family 's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends no happy ending no hope for the future just despair " long day 's journey into night " is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without however after learning more about eugene o'neill 's background and the extent to which the play is based on his life i began to have a greater appreciation for this play o'neill did lead a very hard life therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill 's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner while o'neill 's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending it was appropriate for the play as eugene 's own family never got a happy ending i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family 's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal loving family the audience soon however gets the suspicion that something is n't quite right and that the family is tense slowly the family 's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth although i still believe " long day 's journey into night " to be thoroughly disheartening to read the reader 's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill 's exceptional writing

i owned the vhs version of ' 'the wild wild world' ' but decided to get the dvd this winter wellthat was a great purchase ! i understand people that could see the documentary of jayne in europe as pretty cheaply made but it is still jayne and if you love her ( as i do ) any film she was in ( except the girl ca n't help it and will success spoil rock hunter ) was done on the cheap with ridiculously small budgets ' the wild wild world ' gives you the chance to see a candid jayne in all kinds of very campy situations and the best scenes are when jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on it shows a jayne mansfield who was indeed a true-original rather eccentric person in the anal-retentive american fiftiesi ca n't help comparing her to what anna nicole smith has done with her ' career ' as a media sensation but jayne was doing basically the same fifty years ago which was understandbly much more shocking for the common-folks when jayne talks about her film roles you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself i do n't understand how she can be compared to marilyn monroemm was looking for privacy more serious roles spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to when jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write aboutjayne was not too picky about her roles and the kind of attention she was getting and it was her undoingsad but she needed the money to keep up that image all those children dogs andhusbands now about ' 'the labyrinth of sex'' : it is hysterical ! ! and a great choice to make the dvd a double-feature just like the good-old days of the drive-ins ! when you get over the awful dubbing the documentary is rather well made naive to today 's standards of course but well-intentionnedsome viewers will just see crass-exploitation but if you are into campy kitsch movies and you see ed wood jr as a geniuswell you will love it ! the movie trailers are very funny as well and make you wish you could find them so my conclusion is that dvd is an excellent purchase a must-have for any serious jayne mansfield fan ! !

i read bill bryson 's " a walk in the woods " and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated ( for the " educated " aspect bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents ) i started into " in a sunburned country " with similar expectations and especially since i have always longed and planned to visit australia to state that i was disappointed is a severe understatement after reading this book i now have little to no desire to visit the " land down under ; " my only hope is that i will completely forget what i read in bryson 's book so that i may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting australia ( senility be merciful and consume me hastily ! ) my best estimate is that bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about australia during and / or after his trip his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own i have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as i did with this one bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a " story " relayed second-hand from one of the australians he " met " such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books the only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents these at least provided for some interesting reading after comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of bryson 's books ( " i 'm a stranger here myself " ) after she read " a walk in the woods " it would appear that " in a sunburned country " is not the only snore-fest that bryson has churned out perhaps he is n't a " one hit wonder " but i for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out so if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that bryson provided in " a walk in the woods " look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed

ca n't really add much to the reviews this is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older i 'll admit that when this came out in ' 94 i only bumped the singles it did n't grab me at the time sometime around ' 97 i gave it a spin and i 've been loving it ever since there are plenty of bangers on the album but classics like " pour out a little liquor " " str8 ballin ' " " how long will they mourn me " cradle to the grave " and " under pressure " make this album worth owning all by themselves the rest of the songs are on point too - - there is n't much filler on this album the production is handled by warren g & nate dogg ( 1 ) the awesone yet underrated easy mo b ( 1 ) johnny j ( 1 ) jay & mopreme ( 1 ) jay & syke ( 1 ) stretch ( 1 ) and thug music ( 4 ) i 'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks the only tracks that i would call skip material are " sh** do n't stop " and " do n't get it twisted " " sh** do n't stop " is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive the production is on " do n't get it twisted " cool but it 's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it ( in my opinion ) volume 1 is a passionate if at times misdirected release from the thug life camp the production is nothing short of vintage mid 90 's cali vibes it holds up very well 13 years after its release of course if you 're a tupac completist you probably have this album already but even if you 're not a pac fan this should be a part of your collection rip tupac standout tracks : how long will they mourn me feat nate dogg pour out a little liquor str8 ballin ' ( my favorite ) cradle to the grave under pressure bury me a g feat natasha walker ( of ynv )

i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i was n't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much once he did start playing gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in by the time things settle down the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface the mix is horrible the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the " concert experience " there are high points in the show but the low points are rock bottom comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart two versions are provided on this dvd - from the concert and in the bonus section neither of the guest singers ( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff ) know the words have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience the very best thing on this dvd is oddly enough in the bonus section screamin ' jay hawkins ' i put a spell on you a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland almost makes the dvd worth buying almost watch jonathan demme 's beautiful treatment of neil young : heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show that is the gold standard

i must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were heisenberg 's uncertainty principle was just an equation i learned hawking made it seem like common sense hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times ( and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points ! just in case you missed them ! ) but all-in-all this was a quite readable account of what 's presently known about cosmology i use the term " presently " guardedly as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter ( it exists ! ) but from now on when there are new findings in physics i want hawking to explain them to me because i feel like then i might understand them that 's why you should read this book the reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life and would rather read about global warming or darfur or something a bit more topical and practical this was still a hard read and i feel like i grasped maybe 80% of it for you to decide but for a former engineering student this was something i wish i had read when i was taking physics

as you can see by other reviews above the studio series has a history of being buggy you also hear a lot of people saying " this package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other ' powerful enough to be worth owning ' packages - - if only it were more stable ! " i am one of those long-suffering users ( 5 years going back to version 9 ) and finally with version 106 i have stopped complaining - - it now works as i 'd hoped when i bought it the $300 i spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted - - i kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual could n't clarify and i 'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures i am turning all of our old family video tapes and cd 's into dvd's i use studio for all the editing ( have not tried the dvd recording - - just use roxio for that ) and am now very pleased if you own 105 then version 106 is a free download one important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems : put every " project " you work on in a separate subdirectory if you have 5 soccer game videos make a / game1 / game2 etc series of subfolders if you edit those to a " jimmy 's great plays " proect put it in a separate / jimmyplays folder when projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 105 i learned this trick before 106 came out and i do n't know if it matters any more but i take no chances why did i stick with something where i admit that version 90 was " powerful but unstable " and 100 was " more powerful and more unstable " ? because i can actually use studio with minimal reference to instructions and when i use it things turn out as i expect now that it has become stable and reliable i am a very satisfied customer so that 's how i got from being a frustrated studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review i tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions but that " 105 updated for free to 106 " really is the best choice out there now as my unused expensive rivals to studio on my shelf prove just keep putting every project inn its own folder !

as a lover of gospel bluegrass i anticipated an enjoyable listening session with blue highway 's latest offering let me first say that i am a fan of this group which i consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom but what i heard was bluegrass muzak yes the group 's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing gospel music even bluegrass gospel has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves a good gospel recording must have some cuts which are humorous some serious and contemplative some that push the envelope of orthodoxy and most importantly it must have an element of fun in order to keep the attention of the listeners this disc fails in that regard containing standard old gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards my advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new or buy used want mine

most other reviewers listed here believe that this cd is good - i wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier mannheim cd 's have made it difficult to critique a mannheim offering ! i am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular cd sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music just with different chords in fact if i was not paying specific attention i could n't tell when one song ended and another started ! i enjoyed what i heard but i was certainly expecting more from this cd - many of these disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least some variety seems to have been called for disney has always included great music with their movies running the gamut of musical styles such as classical jazz blues and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high i do however highly recommend mannheim cd 's in general - just not this one

i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti i found the subject interesting and the professor gave wonderful lectures i had good expectations about this book going in but those quickly soured as i read it it seems correct at least about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock not that such is a particularly daunting feet however it is rife with laughable fallacies for instance it calls david bowie amongst other glam rock bands of the era metal it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all such as the carpenters i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs for instance it claims ' thunder rolls ' by garth brooks is about domestic violence its about infedility not focusing on violence at all but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on the writing is also rather dry many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band 's successes or failures after reading the book in completetion i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues ( 50s to 60s ) that i had thought were true in the end i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything

this dvd was the first one released by michael buble and i bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances there are segments of performances but the editing and fast wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect the performances get largely lost what remains is a lot of footage of michael and his original bandmembers drinking clubbing gambling womanizing and generally acting like rowdy frat boys if you really want to be wowed and experience what a live buble concert is like i highly recommend " caught in the act " this dvd lives up to it 's name as part of the pbs great performances series produced by david foster " caught in the act " is slick glossy flashy enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience i 've seen buble perform live twice and i can attest that " caught in the act " is just about as good as being there

following on from the fantastic ' the duel ' allison moorer 's latest release ' getting somewhere ' is a massive massive disappointment quite simply the material on ' getting somewhere ' is weak and gutless on the rare occasions moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of ' the duel ' - such as on hallelujah & new years day - earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! business and pleasure rarely mix and moorer should take a long hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing rs field next time around if moorer wants a guitar groove that burns drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then earle is simply not the man for the job moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre ( she can write a mean song too ! ) this cd showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately

we are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet we cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us ( ie child care ) and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs what 's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured finally the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read

i just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience i must say i think i have figured it out in some other reviews i think batricia birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers i think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground it is somewhat of a good story i can see why it would be reversed ( a guy trying to get the girl instead of the other way around ) you see eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one ? ? ? ? also frenchie is not with the pink ladies at all you see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school i think the chemistry between stephanie and michael were worked well together the songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie so really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether i know i know it is not the first one but sequels are usually not but they usually have connections to the first grease 2 tried to accomplish with frenchie and the tbirds pink ladies and all i am glad they were able to have eve arden sid ceaser plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like tab hunter is this movie cheesy ? ? ? ? yes is it done in less than expected direction ? ? ? ? yes does it have good songs ? ? yes ( cool rider reproduction we 'll always be together girl for all seasons / turn back and back to school ) the song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one after all kiddies patricia birch did do the choreography for both so in closing this movie made it to my dvd collection if for that reason alone if grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek if it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that i think if you loved the first grease then i think you should at least give this one a try

i use pdfs a lot and i must say that quite often i turn to free pdf software to actually do the tasks that acrobat fails to do one area i have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so i switch to the free pdf software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use however if you are a pro pdf maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then i recommend this product hands down as the best one i just find that it is not always the best pdf software package in the world but a good one all the same i would not recommend buying this one just to make standard pdf files alone if you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right

i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book this is not a book about cosmology ( as people would expect from roger penrose ) in this tiny book penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes ( something much different from the opinion of 99 99% of neurobiologists such as steven pinker ) this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell-mann the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories ( thus the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works ! ) some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they did n't had in mind that this book is about penrose 's point of view on intelligence in fact i 'm not a physicist nor a biologist simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand although i do not agree with penrose 's point of view i think he forgot something very important read it and read the other point of view and you 'll find what it is ! :

with a good script and a director better suited to the material ( i 've read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct ) asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson unfortunately the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist 's wife ( an excellent natasha richardson ) and one of the asylum 's patients ( an equally good marton csokas ) under the watchful eye of the patient 's doctor ( ian mckellen ) there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie some of which seem quite preposterous at least in the way the movie was shot the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson she does her best in spite of the choppy script and she even won a best actress award in london for this film however as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job ( in fact i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson credited as an executive producer sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out

this film had a powerful effect on me 95% of the people i know do n't read books i met a millionaire not long ago who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life lady di was reported never to have read anything - - - except perhaps fashion mags my children hardly read and their husbands and wives certainly don't my ex-wife never read anything her father thought ulysses was a dirty book i stopped watching television in 1980 and i own 10 000 books - - - but not fahrenheit 451 which i 'd read about 45 years ago this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury 's text but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear and with a very solid punch to the plexus the manner in which it is written played and directed added to its impact this world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us the style was strange but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal people live and work like automated morons they ca n't think for themselves and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied they ca n't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind : in fact present them with an idea or attempt to initiate a discussion and they 'll often become angry some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts ludicrous suggestions : remake it with mad mel gibson have infantile spielberg direct it bulk it out with computerised sfx these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets and many of them seem unable to understand their own language let alone write it or spell it this is a memorable film for those whose memories still function unlike the captain of the firemen

the author had a great idea but he cherry-picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense for example superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2 two jewish guys right at the end of ww2 write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b / c it 's destroyed etc etc i 'm not critiscizing this book b / c it has a religious message i 'm critiscizing it b / c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement otherwise i disagree with anybody that says it is " just a comic " superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america

overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your panasonic lx1 or lx2 camera but it has a few major flaws first there is no simple way to attach it to your belt there is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it wo n't fit any belt more than 1 / 2 " wide also there are two zippers on this case one on each side which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket finally the velcro tab that closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own this might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase but not for carrying around for everyday use

leather wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper because you know a dvd makes good toilet paper ( maybe it 's why he 's so grumpy ) i would suggest purchasing it and watching it michael moore may be more to the left than some but god has n't anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye ? it 's less biased than the news is - he reports you decide and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion but weren't michael moore is far more honest than the republican talking heads ( rush coulter hannity ) watch enjoy investigate further

while well produced i was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings frankie laine still sounds great - but it just was n't the same i bought the cd to replace a well worn vinyl album but on listening to the cd i found the songs to all be slightly ( and in a couple of cases very ) different in tempo and vocal inflection - it 's definitely not the album i 've loved for over 30 years ! high noon in particular is quite different much slower with vocal emphasis changed i 'll probably listen to the cd from time to time but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp

on an episode of seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is the always wily and oh so goofy character of kramer is playing a game of risk and exclaims that the " ukraine is weeeeak " this causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble i think the same basic sentiments work with this new order release it probably was n't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent " rock the shack " and of course " crystal " which i 'll get back to later unlike kramer i feel i can make this statement safely as i 'm not dealing with a burly alcohol swigging ukranian but new order fans which are n't the most intimidating bunch out there keyboardist gillian gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important which it is maybe this album features the guitar of billy corgan the frontman of the seminal 90 's group soundgarden too bad they could n't get billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy and was n't writing very good material or really using his guitar at all new order also made the mistake of having corgan to backing vocals now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough but to top that off with a billy corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice sosomeone like you is more or less unlistenable it has some pretty terrible lyrics about how bernard does n't want to wash his car now i can relate i would n't want to wash my car in britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair but this topic does n't result in the most captivating and well-written material new order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album something they do n't do very often just like van morrison now i 'm not sure if i 've heard a van morrison song but i 've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars case in point of this ` not so good of an idea rawking ' is rock the shack rock the shack kind of sounds like new order 's take on someone commissioned to write an epic gilligan 's island rock song pretty amazing huh ? ' 60 miles an hour ' ` primitive notion ' and ` close range ' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 's artist like depeche mode the cure and tears for fears ( who 've actually always blown ) however they do succeed fully well on two songs here there is ` crystal ' which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order 's career from the 90 's and beyond how this did n't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song in the vein of ` as it is when it was probably new order 's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album get ready is good beginning and end just not end between kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me

eight years ago today was the day blondie 's reunion album was released and though it was great to see blondie back together no exit just fell short on many levels 2004 's the curse of blondie ( see my review also on amazon ) is a much better album and should have been their comeback no exit wo n't exactly take you back to the hooks that made blondie famous harry 's lyrics are wonderful in " double take " but the deadpan melody literally kills the song fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards ( " boom boom in the zoom zoom room " ) or revamped demo tracks ( " out in the streets " ) but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by coolio both the band and coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about the music is n't catchy either all is not lost with songs like " night wind sent " and harry 's own transformation in " forgive and forget plus who would dare argue blondie 's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear " maria " as the album 's best track " maria " is a wonderful reminder of how blondie and debbie can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind

this is the latest in a never-ending series of books trying to generalize non-business world ( eg sports armed forces girl scouts religion nasa etc ) management techniques to the business world most possibly all are of little value because of major differences 1 ) members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently and face greatly significantly different situations what does eg a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist nurse professor financial analyst etc ? i have no idea 2 ) key success factors vary from one business to another for merck it may be speed of developing new drugs getting through fda approval and motivating physicians to use them for nucor steel it undoubtedly rests much more on low-cost production again what does either have to do with fighter pilots - little if anything one is better off reading books from similar situations - eg about wal-mart ( if you are in retailing ) about allied-signal or ge ( if you are managing a conglomerate ) and about new york community school district #4 as managed by sy fliegel if you are in public school

stiff upper lip is a good ac / dc album it 's not a great ac / dc album it kills me when people say that ac / dc have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done nothing could be further from the truth i have always thought that each ac / dc album has a sound and a feel and a story in it 's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album for instance can you image shake a leg on stiff upper lip ? or ballbreaker on back in black ? it does n't work stiff upper lip has its own kind of rough bluesy feel to it brian 's voice sounds different the tones and the guitars sound different it 's good but not great the standouts 1 stiff upper lip - pretty rocking song has a good attitude it 's fun 2 hold me back and ca n't stand still very odd rolling songs they sound a lot alike again these songs could never have been on back in black i have heard that brian sang ca n't stand still in one take that 's why they all clap at the end i do n't know if that 's true but it 's an interesting song 3 satellite blues - this one is an instant classic i love this song this song could have been done back in the days of back in black and if it were on that album i think it would be as popular as you shook me all night long everything else is ho hum not good not bad better than most bands out there i am really hoping ac / dc put out a killer album with their new release whenever that is i hope they do n't turn into the new g&r and suffer from the chinese democracy syndrome

what is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book - - which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel - - is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24 nope the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced " the great gatsby " a mere five years later " this side of paradise " is a mess : it is as uneven affected feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero the tiresomely self-conscious young minnesotan-gone-to-princeton amory blaine ( one suspects in fact that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory 's diary the result would have been considerably more readable - - or the book 's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable at least ) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 - - it was to prove the most popular book in terms of sales ever produced by its author - - presumably speaks to the public 's recognition of something new and revealing in it okay amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype ; and the drinking and shameless smooching ( etc ) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably one can accept a revelation to see in print ( and likely a titillating one ) for an american audience raised on mcguffy 's readers - - and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war welp here it comes : " on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon the ` petting party ' none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed " to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is of course very small beer what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now in the best cases of the paradise narrative as unalarming quaintness while this is not exactly fitzgerald 's " fault " so to speak it is also true that the use of " shocking revelations " of this type - - scandals specific to a place and time - - represents a risk a writer takes : the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and / or universal in such episodes in any event the price the reader pays here in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory 's adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties is very very high for payoffs of such modest proportions i mean come on : " for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore ; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it eleanor was say the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes " yikes i do n't care what new generation you 're talking about can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody ? ( can it represent anything to anybody ? ) there are things to like even admire here and there in paradise fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark ( eg " they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered " " sometimes i wish i 'd been an englishman ; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy " " it 's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes ; they do it so much better " ) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator 's observations is in its now-curious way refreshingly bracingly funny : " slowly and inevitably yet with a sudden surge at the last while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht] war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings when amory went to washington the next weekend he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks he guessed or russians " nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there 's a war on i always say anyway most of the novel consists of young amory 's elaborate ponderings - - romantic philosophical and egotistical - - which are as forgivable as they are forgettable i 've forgotten them already at some level in any case fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character - - who was of course a not-very-disguised version of himself for how else if not as commendably self-deprecating irony are we to take this observation ? " amory was in full stride confident nervous and jubilant scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours " in the end in any event one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder in paradise almost nothing works : form content narrative stance dialogue character development pacing - - you name it it 's a problem yet in gatsby five years later everything works - - everything if there is to be a great american novel it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b the fact is that he did - - and without point a the journey could not have begun so while " this side of paradise " hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon it surely deserves our respect and indeed our gratitude for what it led to

i respect the message of " the unexpected legacy of divorce " but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce " unexpected " those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time they fell apart due to abuse infidelity and just plain incompatibility what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority who constantly disappoints hurts and replaces the kids there will be damage no getting away from it however is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids seemingly with the other parent 's approval ? i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married this is a major flaw in the research i did n't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference i do n't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid 's whether it 's divorce or starting a new life afterward kids will suffer i do n't like ' studies ' like this they 're misleading and potentially damaging

i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder unfortunately everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the " ancient " sony the color is not nearly as sharp the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself the camera 's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer 's editing program the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights it uses a toggle to control the exposure and while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony it is adequate unfortunately it functions so poorly in low light it would n't provide adequate color in an auditorium i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony maybe it 's because the camera is so small it 's hard to keep as stable as the larger sony video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic 's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony 's digital 8 if you do n't have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera i 'd recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250 if you do have to have a minidv camera and you wo n't be shooting in bright sunlight try another brand this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day otherwise i 'll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality

whether william golding deserved nobel prize or not is still a debatable point but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book and its name is ` lord of the flies ' but let 's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one i am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that you can interpret the meaning of ` lord of the flies ' but who can really visualize it or the imaginary conversations of simon for that matter ? the biggest problem of harry hook 's new version is not the changes done to the film the boys are american military school cadets using dirty words frequently but those parts did n't annoy me much real problem is something more essential to the film which is storytelling in short the 1990 film does n't know what it wants to be on the film 's video cover you can read ( and i quote ) ` this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul " well not exactly for as adventure story it lacks pace ; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing as allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character the conflict between ralph and jack should be clearer and piggy 's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy and do n't forget simon who sees things it is true but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us it is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful it could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop opposite of optimistic tales of jules verne 's adventure stories by watching this film you can follow the story of the book but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it balthazar getty 's feature film debut and lewis m allen one of the producers of the film had also produced peter brook version in 1963

this video 's only redeeming quality is its excellent pilates instruction like all stott videos this one takes extra care to explain proper form and technique unfortunately the aerobics portion is extremely boring and simple you just walk in place the whole time with no interesting variations if you are looking for a video for a beginner this one might work for you if you are truly new to exercise and are really out of shape although i consider myself a beginner when it comes to exercise this video was too easy for me i have n't exercised consistently in several years however i do have a moderately active lifestyle i walk and hike on occassion and i play with my kids at the park- -that sort of thing if you have trouble with everyday activities because you are out of shape this would be a great place to start if you are somewhat fit this video might be too easy for you as well you might also like this video if you feel like you have no coordination there are no fancy moves at all if you can walk you can do this video i like simple steps but this was too simple in general though i think you 'd be better off saving your money and taking a walk spend your money on one of the other excellent stott videos that focuses exclusively on pilates

here 's a good litmus test to show how good a book like " breathing lessons " is- -nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret there are no car chases explosions sex scenes ( barely even any kissing ) or exotic locations no one changes or has an epiphany almost nothing happens- -maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull heck if someone told me the plot of this book i 'd think it was really dull too but i did n't want to put it down the reason is that maggie and ira are so well-drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira that 's how real they seemed to me i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they do n't seem like characters acting their parts ; they seem like real people because of this even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days in all honesty what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i 've ever read about how to write a book this is purely a character-driven novel with very little " plot " except for the death of maggie 's friend 's husband that gets the ball rolling everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie 's personality more than any artificially-generated plot twists it 's hard for me to find any real faults with this book except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes on too long some people may call this boring or dull but i would call it purely exceptional i loved this book and highly recommend it

as a young woman i was appauled by gurian 's lack of respect for women as human beingswhat makes me the most furious is his shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the boys and men to take the lead in lifethe resounding message is girls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because of our hormones make important contributions to society beyond traditional rolesi do n't remember ever being taken over by hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative chemical reactions he believes all females to be i agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishnessgurian is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his books being mindfull of his trickshis book is full of agenda

as a tape measure it does what it says it does you press a button and the tape tightens around your body part you wo n't have to worry about " did i hold the tape tigher last time ? " as the tension is always the same for consistent measurements every time the tape starts measurement at 2 " since the tape casing holds the tape and that part measures around 2 inches i think this tape is accurate plus-or-minus half-an-inch but it sure beats a regular tape measure since at least the button ensures that each time the tape wraps around you at the same tension level

although i have only read a few specific subjects in this book i am only giving it 1 start because the information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and life-threatening disease for anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum ( hg ) reading that a spa day would be beneficial is not only absurd but also insulting many women with hg cannot get to another room of the house without help much less drive a car to a spa ! hg is a disease and not a psychological condition women cannot stop the disease at will this myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children some women have life-long effects (

" house of mirth " is one of the most depressing movies i 've ever seen to be clear : i 've seen movies like oh say " schindler 's list " or " the heart is a lonely hunter " that treat tragic events either in the macrocosm or the microcosm that did not leave me depressed rather they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think " house of mirth " deals with tragic themes including human society 's ability to destroy its own and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites it was n't though moving or thought provoking i was n't moved by gillian anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor i did n't believe gillain anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor rather i was bored i kept wanting the film to go faster it 's a great irony ; edith wharton 's novels are real page turners quick to the point hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality " house of mirth " has gorgeous clothing and sets i did n't care about anybody onscreen though i did n't believe anybody onscreen i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces as if to prove these points : people are hypocrites see ! people are insincere see ! if a person has any decency at all that person is destroyed see ! i would tend to agree with all of the above points so why do i need to watch this movie ? also as a woman who as lily bart was meant to has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that i felt that this movie no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally betrayed lily bart lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film she all but participates in her own destruction you want just once for her to show some initiative some intelligence some ability to create her own fate the film denies her those abilities in this crippling of lily bart the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does movies like " gone with the wind " that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning and occasionally gaining some power imo are much easier to watch one might argue that such films are not realisitic i do n't know even we real-life lily barts have our resources and our triumphs and again watching lily bart in " house of mirth " slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine

i really really really really like allison moorer have been a fan since her first record have road-tripped to see her numerous times and love her songwriting and singing that said - - " getting somewhere " is by far the least satisfying of her records no memorable songs over-produced no " guts " as another reviewer said when the allison moorer / doyle " butch " primm songwriting team called it quits ( in more ways than one ) their lennon / mccartney-caliber teamwork was lost not that moorer sounds like the beatles but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music this cd is not only unmemorable but i doubt i would care to ever listen to it again such a shame i 've never had anything negative to say about allison in the 8 years i 've been a fan but this cd left me cold it hurts a bit to say this but i cannot recommend this cd the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the b-story line from an episode of " the larry sanders show " in that episode sanders ' head writer phil ( played by wallace langham ) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy as a result he lost his edge when he was a miserable person he was an edgy cynical funny jokewriter when he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job same with moorer since her recent changes in her social life she has started " singing a sweeter tune " in her life but it came with a cost she does n't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that " other " songwriter who was so good - - a little edgy sad sometimes bitter or at least that 's how i interpreted it granted that was n't her entire oeuvre but it is what made her songs special for me now she 's happy and she might as well be writing songs for barney the dinosaur

i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes but i have to admit i 'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i 've baked from it so far i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and does n't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter so i was a little skeptical and then reading through the recipes although they are very clearly written there are n't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes the book already assumes a level of competence i made three recipes from the book : the essential chewy sugar cookie the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie and the fudgy brownies all three recipes tasted delicious so i ca n't complain there but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes and both the cookies spread too much - - way too much and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results so right now i 'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up i think it 's okay for a " base " cookie recipe book but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients

i bought this lens in may for my brand new rebel xt i used it on a vacation mainly and am pretty dissapointed i 'm no pro or even skilled amateur but i do know the lens is not giving me quality shots the autofocusing is slow and af or manual shots are n't very sharp at any zoom there seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me i wanted a good all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types i guess this would fit the bill if it took sharp pictures i would n't pay more than $150 for this lens again

we love this camcorder ! we bought it because our other bulky digital video that uses tapes which we would have to copy onto vhs / dvd stopped working we did n't want to spend a lot of money we loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it ( which is very simple to do and you do not have to download any software ) i have to admit i was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great and only 60 minutes concerned me but the pictures is great and i have n't ran out of time yet we have used this indoors outdoors and have no problems we have recorded our son 's basketball games and it worked great we read where the batteries did n't last very long but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have this is a must for those who have children or grandchildren

david bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial this is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial a disco-esque record it 's remembered more fondly than it was received by bowie fans at the time it has some good moments but overall the production is just too slick and there 's a dearth of imagination on it - china girl is an old iggy pop song cat people is just a newer version of a previous single and criminal world is a cover of a song by metro meaning there 's a grand total of five new songs on it china girl proves a perfect foil for bowie 's melodramatic vocals cat people is still great even when smothered in too much production and modern love proves that you 're ( nearly ) always gonna get at least one classic on a bowie album ironically while it made him a global megastar this record also marked the start of bowie 's alarmingly swift fall from grace if he 'd stuck to the highly original work he 'd churned out before this he 'd probably have had his moment in the sun anyway and nobody could have accused him of selling out now what 's that they say about hindsight

i bought this camera in the beginning of january i was looking for a compact camera ( not necessarily pocket size though ) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive which is true after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions with and without flash bright light low light different iso settings different exposure times etc i compared the pictures with my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 and the results were amazing the picture quality of the fuji was very poor colors were ' smeared ' but the main problem was noise even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise same with other colors ( rgb noise ) i did n't check grey / black noise ( as they do in the test reports ) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying what a disappointment the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc-v1 with a carl zeiss lens after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5 this is really a great camera i must admit the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good i can only recommend sony 's h5 even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd what i liked about the f31fd was its size its responsiveness and the monitor and menu however if the picture quality is so poor it also does n't really help

this film starts with an event based on a true crime a talk radio show host in denver was killed by an american nazi ( this event inspired the " talk radio " play and film ) this film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region no mention of their economic status ; are they losing dollars and population small businesses etc instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him ! this seems too exaggerated to believe federal agents are aware of this but do n't want to act yet their agent is sent back to get more information there are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas the film does n't explain what created them it shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions no real names of course the federal agent meets to report to her higher ups then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities ( based on real events ) most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group ( the fbi put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s ) this federal agency does n't interfere because they want more information on their aims ( and their leaders ) more terrorism is planned : dynamiting a courthouse attacking a power station etc the terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day ! kathy finds a secret list of " friends " this is quickly copied with a camera the federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them gary meets with the leader ( who arrives in a helicopter ! ) and shows documents that say kathy is a special investigator is kathy being served up as a sacrifice ? gary and kathy travel to chicago where an assassination is planned that will make gary the fall guy ( another lee harvey oswald ? ) a second " lone gunman " shoots the politician in front of a building gary fails to shoot and wo n't ever try this again costa-gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film " z " a few years later his film about rebels in south america was popular his later films have seemed mediocre a better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does ; better pacing could help the threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film ( eg timothy mcveigh ) those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts a better film today would show the bad results from " nafta " and " free trade " in harming most americans economically but hollywood would never allow a film about this " war on the middle class " the word ` nafta ' in greek and arabic refers to ` petroleum' nafta is a symbol for the policies designed for big oil it is like george w bush calling his policy " operation iraqi liberation "

we bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all " eurocam " for an upcoming trip to europe it promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip sadly the camera is not up to filling this role we will need to take another camera along with it however we will take the v705 for its wide-angle lens the reason that we picked this model in the first place it is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review the need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera if you do not need a 23mm lens or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens then you do not need this otherwise mediocre p&s ( point and shoot ) camera good : fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens ; the 23mm is the default lens ; rapid start-up time ; internal focus and zoom ; chromatic aberration well controlled ; can use 4gb cards ; freeze-frame and extract any video frame mediocre : soft images ; perceptible shutter lag ; slow shot-to-shot times ; exposure compensation is easy but steps are too small for digital and is reset when camera turned off ; flash does not come close to covering the 23mm ; image numbering basically limited to 4 digits ; flimsy construction ; no manual controls ; no raw format ; no optical viewfinder ; histogram on display but too small to be useful bad : the absolute worst menu system to be found on a camera ; excessive and unadjustable jpeg compression ; poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery ; unacceptable visual noise starting at asa-400 ; forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images with inability to save the individual panoramic shots ; panoramic component images forced to 5mp ; overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image ( even with display on ` bright ' ) ; mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results synopsis : if you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot this and the older v570 are the only choices if most of your images are in bright light the 7mp v705 gives better images if most images will be in low light the older cheaper 5mp v570 is the better choice the camera seems very fragile treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance if you chose this as your sole camera you will likely be unhappy with your choice the only reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens = = = = = some expanded comments = = = = = twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens this lens has almost decent optical quality ; though the camera 's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it on power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens which is ideal for us however considering that this is truly a specialty lens it would make more sense that the ` normal ' lens should be the default best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens the camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction this works fairly well at the cost of even more image softness but even-so barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length this in-camera correction can be turned off doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance however being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is the only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as : manual settings a physically larger sensor chip raw image files or at least a choice of degree of jpeg compression at the other end of the camera 's focal length the 114 / 117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion there are very few circumstances where one would want to use ` digital zoom ' so as with all digicams the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus after reaching optical zoom limits one is much better off doing any further ' zooming ' in an editing program kodak 's advertised " 5x optical zoom " is at best misleading actually it is just flat out untrue the camera has two lenses the only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens which is not quite 3:1 the wide angle lens has a fixed focal length ( note in some places kodak claims 39-114 in others 39-117 optical zoom ) also misleading is the claimed " anti-blur technology " as best i can tell from looking at the images and at the exif metadata all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera speaking of asa this is an opportune time to address the camera 's incredibly poor menu system it is byzantine : being both awkward and time consuming to use to adduce ` auto ' asa ranges from 50-200 to set a faster ( or to lock in at a slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels to change from ` auto ' to the next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls ! on either of the other two p&ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control the menu system is next to unusable in the field still on asa settings the camera does have sensitivities up to asa / iso 1000 ( though the manual only documents asas up to 800 1000 is available on the camera ) unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime will never-happen-again moment then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5 " the previous version of this camera v570 had only 5mp but the same sensor size by increasing the pixel count but not the physical size of the sensor the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor this has happened with many of the current p&s cameras as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which when calibrated to the sensor in the camera allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10 " prints at asa 800 if one really wants to get carried away combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography ( where dozens / hundreds / thousands of images are averaged together ) makes 8x10 's at asa 1000 doable people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak 's target market back to earth the v705 's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p&s cameras mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression which is not adjustable ( eg ` best ' ` good ' etc ) my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used this results in small files with a lot of compression artifact the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 12-15mb in size those from another 7mp p&s i have are 5-6mb my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb the more the compression the worse the image most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point kodak picks it for you and picks poorly the v705 's video performance is very disappointing it uses mpeg-4 compression and at very aggressive compression settings unless it is a video of your baby 's first steps or aliens landing in the backyard you will likely find it hard to watch the total output datastream is about 05 mbs compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs ( total adding sound error correction and time codes is 36 mbs ) better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos that is the choice that most manufactures have made as a result the videos from my other p&ss have about a 2 mbs datastream and so are of much better quality the battery kodak 's claim is 150 still images per charge i am getting 100-120 with minimal use of flash and the lcd on ` energy saver' even 150 would be poor compared with my other digital p&ss where i expect at least 200 and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management this camera has a proprietary ( and hard to remove ) 720 mah battery my ( several ) other p&ss have 790-1120 mah batteries and i suspect more efficient processors since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle the battery will likely last most of a day we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera though the body is of aluminum the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use ; there is no cover for the charge socket the media door often dislodges open truly my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used : that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the ( not included in this model ) " easyshare " dock system this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory and the overly aggressive jpeg compression shutter lag the bête noire of digital cameras is very evident with this model i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter and the image being recorded however based on over 50 years of tripping shutters it clearly varies and i estimate is at best 1 / 4 second up to a bit over 1 / 2 second in addition to the shutter lag there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment an active child at a particular instant or a wary animal almost impossible the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation / price p&s cameras from other makers the accompanying ` manual ' is poorly organized childishly written " finish reading this book so you can take and share your best pictures ! " at best it was written for 8 year olds the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the ` full manual ' however the address given is incorrect when eventually found the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level panoramics one of the advertising points of the camera are another disappointment basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in ` panoramic mode ' each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image in order to allow alignment as with most ` panoramic modes ' focus and exposure is locked on the first image so far this is all ok ; however it rapidly goes downhill first the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 ( not 7 ) mp next the image overlay is so dark that even with the lcd set at max brightness it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements however it gets worse the images must be joined in-camera ! the individual images cannot be stored ! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry aligning the overlaps on a grainy 15x2 " lcd in the field gives in spite of the camera 's best efforts much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger and higher quality computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings of course my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera so we will not be dragging it along you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved reading back through this review i see that it is mostly negative this makes sense for as i disclosed at the beginning it was my disappointment in this camera 's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place likely i have said all that needs to be said so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens except for this unique lens the camera 's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p&s cameras currently on the market if you need a true wide-angle p&s you need this camera otherwise forget it

this tribute was announced almost ten years ago and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then to be fair there are some interesting additions such as the sufjan stevens and brad mehldau tracks and emmylou harris is brilliant but sarah mclachlan 's " blue " has been heard before as has prince 's " a case of you " earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like steely dan and lindsey buckingham i sure would like to have heard what they would have done even more disappointing is that joni 's hejira-mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music in my opinion as a final indignity it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase and hence the overall sound quality of the cd is lacking in dynamics

tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient " acetaminophen " acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain making it a great headache reliever or a medication that treats mild strains sprains toothaches etc it also acts to reduce fever acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin one drawback of acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation ( therefore it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction ) it has few side-effects those with liver disease should avoid acetaminophen as it is hard on the liver tylenol ( acetaminophen ) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of reye 's syndrome and aspirin in children tylenol is the manufacturer 's proprietary name for acetaminophen there is a generic form of acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter and this version is much cheaper than " tylenol " and the container usually contains more tablets / pills etc the generic form of acetaminophen is just as effective as tylenol just cheaper priced sometimes acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action for example tylenol pm has diphenhydramine ( the active ingredient in benadryl ) which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine so it work for itching and allergies too tylenol is packaged in different strengths : extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet standard ( 325 mg per tablet ) and children 's dose of 80 mg tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version called " extended release " rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract all in all acetaminophen is a great product if you want a " name brand " of acetaminophen tylenol is your brand ( although it will cost more ) my choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen jim " konedog " koenig

when my virus protection was about to expire i was in a quandary i was n't at all happy with the norton i had purchased last year and i was n't especially pleased with the mcafee i had used the year before that when i checked the local stores there did n't seem to be anything else to choose from i checked amazon and found more options plus plenty of customer comments to help me decide my son told me that bitdefender had been given the highest rating by consumer reports that together with other customer comments on amazon helped me decide to give it a try so far i 'm delighted with its performance in fact when i first installed it it found a virus and some suspicious cookies that norton never caught it does n't appear to be interferring with my system operations ( unlike norton and mcafee ) it and does n't constantly interrupt with pop-ups and unnecessary warnings the best thing is that it gives me two years of protection for the price of one year with the other guys

all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie this is a very well made movie with perfectly competent performances the tone is quite serious and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up but then there are many people who loved titanic which i found utterly depressing more to the point though who cares about the problems of these rich kids ? not me the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful and if you enjoy this film check out less than zero another gloomy but solid ( & underrated ) ' 80s film the worst ' 80s film is bright lights big city - do n't say i did n't warn you !

one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot 's unfurtunate preducices but how come you do n't say something like that about o ' henry we ca n't just stop reading authers because you we do n't like their views someone calls hemingway looking forward ? if that 's looking forward i'de rather look backward hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past but towards what we have made out of the present in name of progress we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous the first draft according to one of eliot 's biographers was absolutly a expression of relavtism one critic accused him being a nihilist on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe so it does n't have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism we could use more of that yet what he does n't right he evoces through mode and tone giving us truly one of the best poems of this or any other century

when i discovered the existence of this novel i was enthusiastic and intrigued unfortunately my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages kleopatra focuses on the famous queen 's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family ( something she may have compensated for in adulthood ) what i liked : 1 ) the spelling of kleopatra / cleopatra with a " k " - it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection ; 2 ) kleopatra 's strength of character - essex 's general characterization is appropriate and it 's easy to see what kleopatra will become although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex it just did n't work for me the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched and although i loved kleopatra 's love interest ( i wo n't give away his name ! ) i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something kleopatra 's dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe as was mohama there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit unnecessary overall although kleopatra was a strong believable character she was in the minority the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt did n't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction ! at least the sequel is better for fiction that works check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george

over the years at various jobs i have seen this flashlight several times it is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse it may end up looking beat up and yucky but they always work no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it if you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox work truck pick-up glove compartment etc this is the only one you need if you need a good flashlight at home and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy i finally bought one just for my home and i am only sorry i did not do this years ago ( i am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox ; i refuse to replace it ) i like this version because it has a strong magnet and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck i also like that it has switch guards so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath 25# of stuff in your toolbox one nit-picky complaint it has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector however it comes empty and you have to supply your own so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight

what they said was that katy ca n't rock just yet because she 's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme i saw her live on the chicks with attitude tour with liz phair and the cardigans and charlotte martin and rose was the worst performer of the night the first problem is that her voice just is n't that strong secondly her lyrics never come out as if they 're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say throughout her set there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing ( passingly honest as well ) and that was " snowflake " it 's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she 's lived in california for a long time but she hates warm weather sounds impossible but she must be truthful because it 's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft i 'm sure she has potential for the future but i think on her next album she should take a hint from beth orton who 's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out and i think that could be helpful for her to put on record

i mean come on who needs 5 blades right ? well after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the mach iii was over a twin head razor i decided that $10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so i took the plunge and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations the first thing i noticed was that this new fusion has a more powerful engine than the mach iii the second thing i found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the mach iii and with very little effort and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore and i find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about but i do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what i mean haw haw 5 blade

i read the book and saw the movie which other than title and major characters have little in common i ca n't say i really liked either the book is a little funnier my major learning from the whole project was when " who wants to be a millionaire " taught me about " roman a clefs " of which " devil " is one perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that " devil " provides meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly editor-in-chief of runway magazine but somehow she 's never quite devil enough anne hathaway is passable in her second ( or third ) " made over princess " role the minor characters including the wonderful tracie thoms as " best friend " lily are mostly wasted

this is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures and it takes wonderful video the downloading is easy and in general it 's a " fine " camera however the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare it 's constantly over exposing every subject i find it practically un-usable the only way i can get the image i 'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the iso to 800 if it had a 1600 iso i would n't need the flash at all practically but it does n't offer that the other thing i do n't like that i did n't realize i would n't like is that it does n't have it 's own cradle in which to charge the batteries the batteries have to be removed and charged seperately does n't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it the batteries lose their charge even when the camera is n't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice intensely dissatisfying this camera also has a really long delay from pushing the button to taking the picture this results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces i know that most digitals have a delay but this one is epic i am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a canon i am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my canon 5d but since this was rated camera of the year by american photo ( a publication i trust implicitly ) i decided to stray from my canon bad idea i 'm going right to a powershot do not pass go do not collect $200 i reccommend you do the same

here 's the good news : i have had many cameras in my life digital and film and i have found the z1 to be my favorite the camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color my previous camera was a minolta dimage 7 ( $800 ) and i found that this camera 's photo quality was just as good the best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life here 's the bad news : recently my camera broke and when i tried to contact fuji to get a replacement or a repair the service was terrible their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support summary : great camera as long as it does n't break it 's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get fuji to repair it

another film in the never-ending series of " giant animated snake eats people " films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade the creators of a maximum-security prison in the antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile there 's nothing more to this film than that " boa " ( also known as " new alcatraz " ) actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness which i do n't think was a smart idea the technical team - photography production design-set decoration etc - create a fairly effective chilling atmosphere but everything else about " boa " is strictly routine dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable although elizabeth lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife and the supporting cast ( mark sheppard grand l bush craig wasson ) is just a touch more professional the film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we ca n't see just how fake it looks i do n't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with ; other similar titles include " python " 1 and 2 " anaconda " ( the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997 ) and " anaconda : search for the blood orchid " and the inevitable " boa vs python " the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors 2 /

i 'm not sure what compelled me to seek out " americano " written and directed by kevin noland it 's not as if i was dying to check up on the career of joshua jackson a star of tv 's " dawson 's creek " perhaps i was intrigued by dennis hopper 's inclusion in such a small scale production- -i mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar here however the lure for him seems to have been his daughter ruthanna who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film maybe it was international star leonor varela a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in america most likely though it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of spain with great scenery bull fights hemingway hard drinking and partying the running of the bulls- -the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing however i am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film i think noland has talent and i look forward to other works the film is photographed well and has good performances my problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming-of-age story with an astounding lack of real character insight this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat the setup is simple as recent college graduates jackson and two pals ( who bicker comically ) are spending the last few days of their vacation in spain before jackson must return to the " real " world and a new job facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood work and independence freedom and monotony dreams and reality- -jackson falls into lust with a local played by varela should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance ? should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure ? should he stay in spain ? these are legitimate questions and a legitimate albeit familiar story path what makes " americano " so tedious and uninvolving however is that the film does n't allow you to know its characters a character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off- -and " americano " does n't succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation we never know anything about jackson 's job or life in america or his dreams passions interests etcaside from this fleeting romance sure the film goes through the requisite motions- -jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of hemingway what else would you expect in spain ? if he has artistic aspirations however the screenplay surely never develops this lacking any real guidance as to what jackson envisions for his life i simply fell into the camp of " who cares ? " there are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of spanish culture dennis hopper 's role however as a club host is a complete misfire ultimately though my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth sure jackson 's at a crossroads- -but lacking any understanding of what he wants it made no difference to me what he chose sorry but that 's a big problem when it is your film 's central theme kgharris 02 / 07

after watching " harsh times " we wondered " is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life ? " we could n't believe what we were watching it was meant to be the new 2006 version of " training day " - -they even got christian bale to play the lead role- -but only in the eyes of the people involved in it it was a miscalculation and we 'll explain why brief story : the movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of la jim davis ( christian bale ) is a mentally unstable young iraq war veteran now in the states he is looking for a job as a cop jim 's best friend mike alonzo ( freddy rodríguez ) is also unemployed but when his friend comes to visit they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities- -selling drugs guns getting high just to name few to spend time with his friend mike has to lie to his girlfriend sylvia ( eva longoria ) making her believe that he is looking for a job she does n't know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face review : " harsh times " has many problems but the most notorious one is the crime " video game " feeling it has throughout the film the characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a " grand theft auto " or " scarface : the world is yours " video game adaptation with a little bit of " cheech & chong " in the mix there is no climax- -we just see them driving to different places arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end christian bale 's accent in this movie does n't help either not only it changes through out the film but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate the dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager-like- -also there is no chemistry between them the acting in this movie is disappointing especially from bale who we liked in movies like " american psycho " " batman returns " and " the prestige " it is clear that he was miscast this time he just cannot do what denzel washington did in " training day " because of his accent and terrible acting in this film we believe this is his worst performance to date this is something he does n't want to add to his resume the verdict : christian bale returns but this new american psycho cannot find his equilibrium " harsh times " tries too hard to create the edgy dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that " training day " had but it does n't even come close to achieve that goal we laugh at the silliness of the story overdramatic acting and christian bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year he probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor this is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent
